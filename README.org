#+title: Joyner Document Format Org Template

** About

This repo is an Emacs Org-Mode recreation of the Joyner Document Format template used in several OMSCS classes. The /official/ LaTeX class can be found on github, at: https://github.com/iamjakewarner/jdf. This project simply allows users to satisfy the style requirements of the Joyner Document Format (JDF) while leveraging the powerful tools that Org-Mode has to offer. Here are a few reasons why using =ox-jdf= and =org-mode= could be useful to you:

+ All files are written in plain text and organized using a basic tree structure. No more having to deal with messy LaTeX code or fighting with Microsoft Word to do what you want.
+ Built-in code block evaluation. Have a piece of code you want to share and evaluate? Org-Mode can handle nearly any language and can combine different languages within one document.
+ Easy to use references, citations, labels, and footnotes. I suggest checking out [[https://github.com/jkitchin/org-ref][org-ref]] for quick and easy management of all your document references.
+ Something not exporting quite right? Org-Mode exports to an intermediary =.tex= file so you can make any neccesary modifications.
+ But don't worry about changing the =.tex= file! You can place LaTeX directly into your document issue.
+ Insane table support! You can treat org-tables as spreadsheets with formulas and lookup values.
+ Many, many more!
